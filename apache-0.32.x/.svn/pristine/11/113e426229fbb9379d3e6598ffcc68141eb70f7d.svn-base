<section id="Java-Broker-Security-Authentication-Providers">
  <title>Authentication Providers</title>

  <para> In order to successfully establish a connection to the Java Broker, the connection must be
    authenticated. The Java Broker supports a number of different authentication schemes, each with
    its own "authentication provider". Any number of Authentication Providers can be configured on
    the Broker at the same time. </para>

  <important>
    <para> Only unused Authentication Provider can be deleted. For delete requests attempting to
      delete Authentication Provider associated with the Ports, the errors will be returned and
      delete operations will be aborted. It is possible to change the Authentication Provider on
      Port at runtime. However, the Broker restart is required for changes on Port to take effect.
